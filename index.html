                      we usually split into teams or solo on those tasks, while modifying the code we apply TTD using Rspec to verify
                      automatically that the expected inputs and outputs are correct, once the tasks were finished, we change the task
                      status to finished using pivotal tracker, to let the Senior developers or owners of the task review those changes via
                      GitHub. Every tasks made was headed towards the company's main platform, a WebApp developed in Ruby on
                      Rails. We followed strictly Scrum work methodology.

                      degree evaluations to check if there was any inconveniences the employees had with other employees or
                      superiors. Based on the technologies my partner and I had and the technologies the company use, we decided to
                      design the platforms architecture, generally speaking, the developed platform was a Web application made with
                      CodeIgniter and PHP, a system that follows the work structure of MVC with a MySQL database. The platform
                      allowed users to have different evaluators depending on the employee's area, if the employee was part of the HR
                      area he had the role of administrator of the platform, otherwise the employee should only evaluate and be
                      evaluated.

                      evaluated convenience stores follow a designed planogram, my team and I developed a web application that can
                      be used responsively on smartphones, allowing evaluators to take a picture to the shelves and get feedback by
                      Amazon Rekognition’s service called Custom Labels, where an Image recognition model was trained in other to
                      recognize the products of a planogram and with the given coordinates of the detected labels, check if the detected
                      products are aligned as the planogram defines.

                      Yireh is a platform that allows the management of insurance money for the employees of different offices in the company, I applied here the roles and permissions funcionality using Spatie permissions library,
                      the admin had full controll of the platform, while the contributors had limited access and options to navigate and manipulate the data. Most of my work in this project was front-end oriented, where we used React jsx view components,
                      and fetch the display data via Axios.

                      My main duty in this project was to implement and redesign the mailer templates because they were using the default template that provides Laravel,
                      additionally I worked on the automatic validation via the government API that validates whether the uploaded document is approved or not by the law, the
                      documents that the user uploades could either be custom specific files or documents for the following organizations: INFONAVIT, IMSS, REPSE and SAT.

                      This was the first application developed using FlutterFlow as our Front-end in the company, the team and I were developing as we were learning how to design and connect
                      the API we built in PHP Laravel to manage sessions, users, and roles in the platform. The application consisted of a reward system for customers of a Yoga
                      Studio, where users check-in and get discounts and cash rewards with the accumulated points per activities and visits. All the system was made from start to finish in a lapse of 4 months.
